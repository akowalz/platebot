# PlateBot

PlateBot is a way to get dinner saved for you when you're on the go.  It was designed for [MOSAIC Co-op](http://mosaiccoop.org), which holds nightly house dinners and allows it's members to request "late plates" be saved for them when they won't be around at dinnertime.  The old system to request a late plate was a Google Spreadsheet that members could add themselves to nightly, but this is clunky and difficult when you are on the go.  PlateBot utilites the [Twilio API](twilio.com) to introduce an SMS text message interface for late plating.  Now, if wherever you are, you send a text and know that dinner will be waiting at home.
